# Caesar and Vigenère Ciphers

This repository contains Python implementations of two classical encryption techniques: Caesar Cipher and Vigenère Cipher. Each cipher has its encryption and decryption functions, along with interactive menus for user input.

## Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

### Functions:

- `caesar_cipher(text, key)`: Encrypts `text` using the Caesar Cipher with the given numerical `key`.
- `caesar_decipher(ciphertext, key)`: Decrypts `ciphertext` encrypted with Caesar Cipher using the reverse `key`.

## Usage

The ciphers are implemented as functions and can be used programmatically or through interactive menus provided in main_menu(), caesar_cipher_menu(), and vigenere_cipher_menu().

### How to Run

git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-vigenere-ciphers.git
cd caesar-vigenere-ciphers
python ciphers.py
